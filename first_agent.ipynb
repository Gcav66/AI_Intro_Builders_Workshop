            "\n",
            "Here's the breakdown of its origin:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **The Original Vine (2013):** A short video was uploaded to Vine in **2013** featuring two young boys. One boy asks the other, \"What's 9 + 10?\" The other boy confidently replies, \"21.\" The first boy then exclaims, \"You stupid!\" to which the second boy defiantly responds, \"No I'm not!\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **The \"6-7\" Extension:** While the \"9 + 10 = 21\" part became instantly iconic due to the confident wrong answer, the subsequent insult, and the defensive denial, the \"6-7\" question often arose in follow-up Vines or as people referenced the original meme.\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   In some versions or interpretations, the first boy would continue to \"test\" the second boy.\n",
            "    *   The joke with \"6-7\" (or similar simple math problems) is that the second boy would likely give the **correct answer** (e.g., \"13\"), but the first boy, still locked into the \"you're stupid\" mindset, would **still dismiss it** or say \"No!\"—reinforcing the absurdity and the fixed perception of the questioner.\n",
            "\n",
            "Essentially, the '6-7' part emphasizes the futility of trying to prove oneself to someone who has already decided you're wrong, even when you are factually correct. It takes the humor of the initial \"9 + 10 = 21\" exchange and pushes it further into the realm of exasperation and stubbornness.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, while \"9 + 10 = 21\" is the core, \"6-7\" is a secondary question used to highlight the continued (and often irrational) dismissal of correct answers by the \"quizzer.\"\n"

            "The phrase originated from the 2024 drill rap song \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" by rapper Skrilla. In the song, Skrilla raps the lyric \"6-7, I just bipped right on the highway\". The exact meaning of \"6-7\" within the song itself is debated, with some speculating it could refer to 67th Street in Philadelphia, or possibly the police code \"10-67\" for a death.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Spread and Popularity:**\n",
            "The song gained traction on social media, particularly in video edits featuring professional basketball players, most notably LaMelo Ball, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. The meme was further popularized by Overtime Elite player Taylen \"TK\" Kinney, who frequently used the phrase. A viral video of a young boy, dubbed the \"67 Kid,\" yelling \"6-7\" at a basketball game also significantly boosted its popularity.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Meaning and Usage:**\n",
            "The \"6-7\" meme is often used in a nonsensical or absurd context. Its lack of a clear meaning makes it an inside joke for those who are \"in the know\" and can be used to confuse or amuse adults. While some have tried to assign meanings, such as a way to describe mediocre content or a tall person, the general consensus is that the randomness is the point. It has been used in various scenarios, from commenting on test scores to being a general exclamation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The meme has become so widespread that Dictionary.com named \"67\" its Word of the Year for 2025. It has also been described as a form of \"brain rot\" and has led to some schools banning its use due to disruptions.\n"
