# AI_Intro_Builders_Workshop
This repository contains the material for the workshop Demystifying AI: AI Introduction For Builders &amp; Designers

## Objectives:
* ✓ Build intuition through hands-on exercises that reveal how AI actually works
* ✓ Rigorous workshop requiring active participation and a willingness to try new things (even write code!)
* ✓ Develop strategic thinking about when and how to deploy AI in your organization
* ✓ No coding experience required—just curiosity and willingness to learn

## Why this workshop
* Practical, hands-on focus:  build a working AI agent from scratch in 2.5 hours (Python + free Google tools)
* The "aha moment": Struggle through traditional ML first to really GRASP why LLMs matter, not just how to use it
* Great resume line + GitHub project you can point to in interviews
* Exposure to agentic AI workflows (tool use, function calling) that most tutorials skip or don’t explain just how powerful these are!

## Core Text
* Concepts & Code Examples from Antonio Gulli's wonderful book AI Design: A Beginner's Guide to Building Intelligence Through Patterns
